    <h2>About Mathematics</h2>
    <p>Mathematics (from Ancient Greek μάθημα; máthēma: 'knowledge, study, learning') is an area of knowledge that
        includes such topics as numbers (arithmetic and number theory),[1] formulas and related structures (algebra),[2]
        shapes and the spaces in which they are contained (geometry),[1] and quantities and their changes (calculus and
        analysis).[3][4][5] Most mathematical activity involves the use of pure reason to discover or prove the
        properties of abstract objects, which consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern
        mathematics—entities that are stipulated with certain properties, called axioms. A mathematical proof consists
        of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved
        theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true
        starting points of the theory under consideration.

        Mathematics is used in science for modeling phenomena, which then allows predictions to be made from
        experimental laws. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of
        such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model. Inaccurate predictions, rather than being caused by
        incorrect mathematics, imply the need to change the mathematical model used. For example, the perihelion
        precession of Mercury could only be explained after the emergence of Einstein's general relativity, which
        replaced Newton's law of gravitation as a better mathematical model.

        Mathematics is essential in the sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and the social
        sciences. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with
        their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other mathematical areas are developed
        independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are
        often discovered later.[6][7] A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization, which goes back to
        Euclid, but which had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for the security of
        computer networks).

        Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics,
        most notably in Euclid's Elements.[8] Since its beginning, mathematics were essentially divided into geometry,
        and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when
        algebra[b] and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new areas of the subject. Since then, the interaction
        between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a rapid increase in the development of
        mathematics. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization
        of the axiomatic method. This gave rise to a dramatic increase in the number of mathematics areas and their
        fields of applications. An example of this is the Mathematics Subject Classification, which lists more than 60
        first-level areas of mathematics.</p>
